                I have volunteered 156 hours total at the hospital's physical therapy department.
                There, I ran errands, cared for patients, <br>and performed regular maintanence
                checks on physical therapy equipment. Volunteering there was easily one of my favorite
                places to volunteer;<br> I really felt like I was making a difference. 
                I would recommend it to anyone who wants to broaden their horizons <br>and meet 
                people from all walks of life!

                I have volunteered over 70 hours at my local library when I am at home. There,
                I got to know the staff very well while greeting/helping patrons, <br>organizing
                shelves, and performing visitor counts. I've loved books for as long as I can remember,
                so volunteering here was a joy. <br> 
                While its not for everyone, being able to help others who are in the shoes of my younger
                self is something that I hope I can continue to do.

                Over Thanksgiving and Winter break, I plan to volunteer at my local soup kitchen.
                My mom and brother have been volunteering there <br> since the summer of 2023, and 
                when the Fall 2023 semester lets out, I plan to join them there.
