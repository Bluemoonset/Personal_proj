                I have volunteered over 70 hours at my local library when I am at home. There,
                I got to know the staff very well while greeting/helping patrons, <br>organizing
                shelves, and performing visitor counts.

                Over Thanksgiving and Winter break, I plan to volunteer at my local soup kitchen.
                My mom and brother have been volunteering there <br> since the summer of 2023, and 
                when the Fall 2023 semester lets out, I plan to join them there.
