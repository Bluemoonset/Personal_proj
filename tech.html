            <div class="projbod">
                A Python-based web-scraper for Slickdeals that would collect data from a 
                search and provide the user with data such as the average <br>
                price for the search item or what time of year would 
                be most likely to have the best deals. Data would be stored <br>
                inside Excel files and were readily available to view in the 
                form of charts.

            <h3 class="projhead">Custom linux terminal</h3>
            <div class="projbod">
                A terminal written in C++ for an operating systems class. This 
                terminal replicated the functions of commonly used terminals like <br>
                Ubuntu, being able to run commands, change directories, or even 
                generate keys.

            <div class="projbod">
                A project that I have wanted to start for a long while is
                a depth-perception camera. I originally planned to have <br>
                two cameras placed on mounts that could move left and right
                which, combined with the same-time viewing from the cameras <br>
                allow an accurate detection of distance from the camera.
                If this project were to succeed, I'd like to expand upon it <br>
                by integrating it into a phone plugin with its own app.
